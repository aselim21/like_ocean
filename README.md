# Like an Ocean

https://ocean-ag.herokuapp.com/

Using the technology of WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication and WebSockets, Like an Ocean enables secure video communication with some nice options like: 
* Creating oceans (video chat rooms) with name and password
* Addding specific fish (video call participant) to the ocean
* Muting and unmuting the other participant
* Removing your own video of the screen, while it is still sending your video

**The usual functionalities like muting/unmuting yourself and stoping your video are also available

Pay attention that the web application is working properly only with Chrome Browser and on Wifi, becasue of the restrictions that come with WebRTC and not using third party TURN Server(which will enable using of Mobile Data during the calls).
